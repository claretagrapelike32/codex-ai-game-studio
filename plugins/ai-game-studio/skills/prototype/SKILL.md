description: "Concept prototype — validate the core idea is worth designing before writing GDDs. Run right after $ai-game-studio:brainstorm and $ai-game-studio:setup-engine. Routes to HTML, Engine, or Paper path based on game type. Produces a throwaway build and a PROCEED/PIVOT/KILL verdict."

# Prototype

This is a full-fidelity Codex port of a large upstream studio workflow. Its
detailed phases, templates, checks, and handoff prompts live in
[`references/full-workflow.md`](references/full-workflow.md) to keep skill
discovery lightweight.

## Required procedure

1. Read `references/full-workflow.md` completely before executing this skill.
2. Follow its phases in order and preserve all approval, review, testing, and
   evidence gates.
3. Adapt shell syntax to the detected platform; use PowerShell on Windows and
   POSIX syntax on macOS/Linux.
4. Inherit the active Codex model and permission mode. Never weaken sandbox,
   approval, provenance, or human creative-control boundaries.
5. If a referenced project artifact is absent, report the gap and use the
   documented fallback instead of inventing completion evidence.
