description: "Holistic cross-GDD consistency and game design review. Reads all system GDDs simultaneously and checks for contradictions between them, stale references, ownership conflicts, formula incompatibilities, and game design theory violations (dominant strategies, economic imbalance, cognitive overload, pillar drift). Run after all MVP GDDs are written, before architecture begins."

# Review All Gdds

This is a full-fidelity Codex port of a large upstream studio workflow. Its
detailed phases, templates, checks, and handoff prompts live in
[`references/full-workflow.md`](references/full-workflow.md) to keep skill
discovery lightweight.

## Required procedure

1. Read `references/full-workflow.md` completely before executing this skill.
2. Follow its phases in order and preserve all approval, review, testing, and
   evidence gates.
3. Adapt shell syntax to the detected platform; use PowerShell on Windows and
   POSIX syntax on macOS/Linux.
4. Inherit the active Codex model and permission mode. Never weaken sandbox,
   approval, provenance, or human creative-control boundaries.
5. If a referenced project artifact is absent, report the gap and use the
   documented fallback instead of inventing completion evidence.
