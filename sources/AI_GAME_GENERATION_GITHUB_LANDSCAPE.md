# AI Game Generation on GitHub: Repository Landscape

Snapshot: 2026-07-30

This is a broad, high-signal catalog of public GitHub repositories for AI-assisted or AI-generated games. It intentionally removes most forks, one-off student demos, SEO repositories, and tiny clones. It is not literally every repository on GitHub; GitHub search is continuously changing and many projects do not use consistent topics.

Legend:

- **Production/tool**: usable in a real workflow today, subject to normal evaluation.
- **Research**: paper implementation, benchmark, or experimental model; often GPU-heavy.
- **Building block**: general technology that becomes game-relevant when placed in an asset or studio pipeline.
- **Index/skills**: curated links or agent instructions rather than a generator model.

Important: a repository's code license does not automatically cover its model weights, datasets, generated assets, game-engine SDKs, or third-party dependencies. Check all of them before commercial use.

## Recommended stacks

### Fast 2D/browser game generation

1. OpenGame or a conventional coding agent for the playable game.
2. Agent Sprite Forge, SpriteBrew, or a ComfyUI + ControlNet workflow for art.
3. Aseprite MCP or Pixelorama for deterministic repair and consistent exports.
4. PlayCoder/OpenGame-Bench plus Playwright for functional and visual checks.
5. IQA-PyTorch plus a human review rubric for final art selection.

### Unity 3D asset pipeline

1. CoplayDev Unity MCP for editor control and tests.
2. Hunyuan3D-2.1, TRELLIS, or TripoSG for source meshes.
3. MeshAnything for topology experiments; inspect collision and LOD manually.
4. UniRig or Puppeteer for rigging; MotionGPT/MoMask for motion candidates.
5. Blender MCP or StableGen for UV, PBR, bake, decimation, and export.
6. glTF Validator, meshoptimizer, Unity tests, screenshots, and human sign-off.

### Godot 2D/3D workflow

1. Coding-Solo Godot MCP or Fennara for editor feedback.
2. Agent Sprite Forge / pixel-mcp for 2D, or TRELLIS / Hunyuan3D for 3D.
3. Godot RL Agents for repeatable behavior and playtest environments.
4. Engine screenshots plus PlayCoder-style VLM checks and deterministic assertions.

### Unreal world-building workflow

1. Unreal MCP or UnrealClaude for editor and project operations.
2. HY-World 2.0, HunyuanWorld, WorldGen, or Infinigen for environment sources.
3. Hunyuan3D/TRELLIS plus UniRig for individual characters and props.
4. Blender/StableGen for final optimization and PBR bake.
5. Unreal automation tests, packaged-build smoke tests, screenshot comparison, and gameplay capture review.

### Interactive world-model research

1. Matrix-Game or HY-WorldPlay for recent streaming systems.
2. Open Oasis, MineWorld, DIAMOND, and GameFactory as reproducible baselines.
3. World Arcade as a convenient launcher where supported.
4. GamingAgent/BALROG-style evaluation for controllability and long-horizon behavior.

## Minimum quality gate for generated game assets

1. **Rights**: code, weights, dataset, source-reference, voice, and generated-output terms are acceptable.
2. **Technical validity**: format parses; transforms, scale, axes, normals, UVs, materials, bones, animation clips, LODs, and collision are valid.
3. **Visual consistency**: silhouette, palette, proportions, identity, texel density, seams, and lighting remain consistent across views/frames.
4. **Runtime budget**: triangle count, texture memory, shader complexity, draw calls, animation cost, and loading time meet the target platform.
5. **Playability**: the asset behaves correctly in an actual build, not only in a turntable render.
6. **Regression evidence**: store engine screenshots/video, automated results, generation settings, model/weight versions, and source commit.
7. **Human approval**: art direction, fun, readability, originality, and legal risk still require a responsible reviewer.
